# combiGames
Playaround with combinations.

The case should test how to easily get the row sums (or another mathematical transformation) of any possible combination of columns/features of a data set.

## Content:
- Jyupter Notebook (containing the code for the small case)
- pipfile & pipfile.lock for easy installation of needed packages (optional)

## Prerequisites
There are several packages needed to run the notebook.
First of all jupyter notebook. Also Pandas and Numpy are required.
Also python 3.8.5 was used to create the notebook.

If you do not have these packages installed on your machine, you can easy install either all necessary packages with the pipfile or do it manually.

The recommended way, though, is to use a virtual environment manager like pipenv and use:

```
~$ pipenv install
```
